i've never worked for a faang company. in my senior year of college, i decided that i never would because i didn't feel capable enough to get a job there.

don't get me wrong - i trust my abilities, but i also know my limits. i know i cannot excel by solely focusing on engineering.

hence, all these good practices i'm about to share come from my experience working with more experienced engineers remotely.

## mindset

### 1. think like a scientist

the first thing is that you must think like a scientist - your company will benefit from that mindset.

### 2. communicate with evidence

when you communicate, make sure you provide evidence for your statements. otherwise, you're asking your team to trust your word.

## tools

- linear: project management
- github: code hosting
- slack: communication
- figma: design
- mintlify: documentation
- cursor: code editor

## workflows

- ci/cd: automated build and deployment pipeline
- tests: ensuring code reliability
- linters: catching code issues early
- formatters: maintaining consistent style

## best practices

- keep environment variables in your hosting service (vercel, expo, etc.) to maintain a single source of truth for your team
